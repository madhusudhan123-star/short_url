Examples
Here are some examples of how you can use the modules provided by this package:
javascriptCopy codeconst { http, fs, path, url, PORT, express } = require('<package-name>');

// Using the http module
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello, World!\n');
});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${PORT}/`);
});

// Using the fs module
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'data.txt');
fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(data);
});

// Using the express module
const app = express();
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Express server running at http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
